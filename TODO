  choose metaprogramming tools
    bash

    operators and primitives
    compiled words

    primitive
      dependencies
      code block
      lexical context
        e dp ip rp sp
    address model
    execution method
    word layout (including direct vs indirect)
1. discover which optimizations cause failures in absolute addressing
   individually and pairwise for individual optimizations,
   no segfaults/bus errors, but -O1 still fails
6. switch based dispatch
2. separate primitive impl from dictionary init
4. interpreter structure test harness
    f0
    itemize functional pieces by execution model
      primitive declaration
        threaded: none
        subroutine: local function declaration
        switch: none
      primitive implementations
        threading: labeled block
        subroutine: local function

    single cli command to

      exercise all state transitions

    dimensions
      word size: 16, 32, 64
      compilation target: 32, 64
      address mode: absolute, relative
      reference model: direct, indirect
      dispatch model: switched, subroutine, threaded
    allowable region:
      absolute address => word size = compilation target
      word size <= compilation target
    combinations
      absolute addressing: 12 (compilation target * reference model * dispatch model)
      relative addressing:
        word size 16: 12 (compilation target * reference model * dispatch model)
        word size 32: 12 (compilation target * reference model * dispatch model)
        word size 64: 6 (reference model * dispatch model)

    _is_primitive -- true if cell represents a primitive
    _pr_deref     -- cell to (void *), referring to the implementation of a primitive
    _from_ptr     -- translates a (cell *) to a cell, inverse of _to_ptr
    _to_ptr       -- translates a cell which references another to (cell *), inverse of _from_ptr

5. indirect threading
7. load/save relocatable images
8. multi-threading
9. local multi-process
10. indirect primitives for 2 byte word size, or translate more primitives to compiled
11. token-based dispatch (ie, op_X and pr_X are mapped to/from enum)
    might be necessary if compiled code for relocatable 16-bit forth > 32kb.
14. other compilers: clang, bcc, tcc, pcc, icc

    test suite
      double number words

    selected (all?) items from reference word set
