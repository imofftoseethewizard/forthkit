1. discover which optimizations cause failures
   individually and pairwise for individual optimizations,
   no segfaults/bus errors, but -O1 still fails
2. threading model: relative labels instead of absolute
   done
3. use relative labels to support cell size < machine word size
   problematic. Having a different cell size than machine word size forces
   an abstraction everywhere a pointer is converted to a cell, or vv.
   done
4. subroutine threading
   partial work in branch "subroutine-threading", but introduces ordering
   dependency in primitive definitions.
